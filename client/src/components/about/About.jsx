        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hi! My name is Axel and I am the creator of this SPA.</p>
        <p>
          This Project was made while studying in Henry's bootcamp, as my
          individual project.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's made from bottom to top by me, meaning i developed both backend
          and frontend.
        </p>
        <p>
